# Supermarket Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project utilizes K-Means clustering to segment supermarket customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer transaction records with features such as:

- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing features to ensure equal weight in clustering.
4. **Optimal Cluster Determination**: Using the Elbow Method to find the ideal number of clusters.
5. **K-Means Clustering**: Applying the algorithm to segment customers.
6. **Visualization**: Plotting clusters to interpret customer segments.

## Results

The analysis revealed distinct customer segments, each with unique characteristics. These insights can help tailor marketing efforts and improve customer engagement.
